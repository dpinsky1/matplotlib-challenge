# matplotlib-challenge

During this challenge, I crossed a pretty big milestone in my book. I completed this challenge with no live help. 
That's a big deal to me, since I feel like I've gotten so much help on all the previous challenges. 
For the first time, I feel like I can do this for a living. Which feels great.

Pymaceuticals is a script that will read in data from two CSVs and merge them. 
Duplicates are located and removed from the dataset. 
Summary statistics are generated and displayed in a dataframe. 
Various data visualizations are displayed under the summary dataframe: Bar Charts, Pie Charts,  a Scatter Plot, and a Linear Regression of the Scatter Plot. 
Also included is a dataframe displaying the final tumor volume of the four most promising drugs in the study. 
A box plot to show tumor volumes among those four regimens and their ranges and outliers is also included. 
A visualzation showing a single mouse's tumor size over time while on the drug Capomulin is included to illustrate the drug's efficacy in shrinking tumors.
